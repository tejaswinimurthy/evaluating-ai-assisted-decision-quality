# Evaluating AI-Assisted Decision Quality

This project evaluates whether a new computer model improves **human decision-making** compared to an existing model, using evidence from a small-scale A/B-style experiment.

Rather than focusing on predictive accuracy alone, the analysis assesses **decision quality**, error severity, and whether observed improvements justify deployment in practice.
